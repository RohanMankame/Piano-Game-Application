Piano-Game-Application
Built a project in JAVA for my CMPSC211 class and developed a strong foundation in using OOP. 
The project was a Piano app that allowed users to play music on a virtual piano, to do this I used GUIs. 
The program allowed the user to record their music and save it to a database. I developed the database using MySQL. 
My database allowed multiple users to upload their recordings, further users could listen to music recordings already saved in the database. 
Other features include pause recording and cut recording functionality. Built a clear understanding of app development and database implementation

The src file contains all files including the mp3 music files. But outside this, I have placed my code files in the regular folder as seen, theses are also duplicated in the src.
